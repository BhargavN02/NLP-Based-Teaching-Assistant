let's look into the expectation and variance of discrete random variables here is an example of a probability distribution for a discrete random variable X that we're going to work with a little bit later on in this video capital X represents the random variable lowercase X is representing the values the random variable can take on so here our random variable X can take on the values 0 1 or 2 and it takes those values on with these probabilities one of the points of interest for us might be in finding the mean and the variance of the random variable X the expected value of a random variable is the theoretical mean of the random variable it is not based on sample data it is based on the distribution of the random variable so the expected value is a parameter and not a statistic to calculate the expected value for a discrete random variable X we have this formula our expectation of our discrete random variable X is equal to the sum of x times P of x over all X and so what we're doing is we're taking all the possible values of X and we're waiting them by their probabilities of occurring and summing it up over all those X's and so what we end up with there is our overall expectation or in other words the mean of the random variable X and we call that parameter expectation of X or sometimes we might refer to it as mu the Greek letter mu meaning the mean of the random variable X or the mean of its probability distribution this can be extended to the expectation of some function of the random variable so here G of X represents a function of the random variable could be x squared of the square root of x or log X or something along those lines and the expectation of a function of the random variable well we just do similar thing to what we did on the last page we take the values of the function and we multiply them by the probability of those values occurring we add that up over all x1 important quantity for us is the variance of X which is the expectation of X minus mu squared what is this doing well this is the average squared distance from the mean and we're going to call that the variance of X and to find that we simply evaluate that function at every possible value of x and multiply those by their probabilities of occurring and then add it up over all X now this variance of X again this is going to be a parameter and not a statistic this is based on the real probability distribution and we sometimes represent the variance of a probability distribution by the symbol Sigma squared here's a handy relationship for us both in doing some of the calculations and in some theoretical work this expectation of X minus mu squared that we looked at on the last page we can use that formula from the last page but if we square this out and carry the expectation through this can be shown to be equal to the expectation of x squared minus the expectation of X all squared or another way of writing this is that this is equal to the expectation of x squared minus mu squared note that this quantity here and this quantity here are not the same thing now this can be handy in some of the calculations because perhaps mu might be some ugly number with lots of decimal places or what-have-you and using the formula from the last page might result in a lot of roundoff error and also we've often already calculated mu so to calculate the variance which is this thing we might just need to calculate the expectation of x squared in addition and this can be a fairly easy calculation to carry out let's do an example of some of these calculations suppose that 60 percent of American adults approve of the way the president is handling his job and we randomly sample two American adults and we'll we let the random variable X represent the number of those adults that approve and so our random variable X is going to take on the values 0 1 or 2 those are the possible values for a random variable X and we can calculate the probability of those zero one and two from the idea that we have 60 percent of American adults approving and we are randomly and independently sampling to American adults and I show how to go through those calculations in my introduction to discrete random variables video if we were to do that we end up with this discrete probability distribution here now we might want the mean and the variance of the standard deviation of this probability distribution so let's walk through some of those calculations now suppose we want to find the expectation of a random variable X or in other words the mean of the random variable X we're going to use this formula where we take each x times its probability of occurring and add it up over all X or in other words here we would take zero times its probability of occurring plus one times its probability of occurring plus two times its probability of occurring and add that up over all of our values if we were to do so we get that this is equal to one point two the expected value of x is equal to one point two now note that this one point two is not one of the possible values of X when we say the expectation of X we're not saying a value of x that we would expect to get we are talking about its expectation the theoretical mean of the random variable X suppose we want the expectation of x squared well we do a very similar thing we just want the sum of x squared times P of X so we just go to our probability distribution we take each value of x square it times its probability of occurring 1 squared times point 0 4 a 2 squared times point zero three six if we do that for all of our values we end up with one point nine two so the expectation of x squared is 1 point 9 - now suppose we want to find our variance or in other words our expectation of X minus mu squared well we go about it at a very very similar way each X minus mu squared times the probability of occurring so we would simply say well our first value is 0 we subtract the mean that we found previously 1 point to square it and multiply that by its probability of occurring and we do a similar thing over here 1 minus 1.2 squared is probability of occurring we do that for all the values add them up and we get that this is equal to zero point four eight so Sigma squared the variance of our discrete random variable X is equal to zero point four eight and if we wanted the standard deviation Sigma the standard deviation of our random variable X that is simply going to be equal to this square root of zero point four eight let's go back and take another look at this relationship this relationship holds for any distribution but let's verify that it works in our case we just calculated that this quantity the variance is equal to zero point four eight and we also calculated that the expectation of x squared is equal to one point nine two and that the expectation of X is equal to one point two and if we calculate one point nine two minus one point two squared we'd see that that equals zero point four eight so these two quantities are in fact equal now we didn't have to actually use that relationship here because this quantity was quite easy to calculate but sometimes this is a very handy relationship for us
